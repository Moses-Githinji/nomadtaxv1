# Partner Logos Setup

## 📁 Directory Created

A `public/partners/` directory has been created for partner logos.

## 🎨 Required Partner Logos

Please add the following logo files to `public/partners/`:

1. `safaricom.png` - Safaricom logo
2. `etica.png` - Etica logo
3. `ndovu.png` - Ndovu logo
4. `britam.png` - Britam logo
5. `equity.png` - Equity Bank logo
6. `im-bank.png` - I&M Bank logo
7. `kra.png` - KRA logo
8. `sanlam.png` - Sanlam logo
9. `cic.png` - CIC logo

## 📐 Recommended Logo Specifications

- **Format**: PNG with transparent background (preferred) or SVG
- **Size**: Ideally 200-400px wide
- **Aspect Ratio**: Logos will be displayed in a 192x96px container
- **Color**: Full color (component applies grayscale filter, removes on hover)

## ✅ Current Status

The Partners section is now live on the landing page with:
- ✨ Smooth infinite scroll animation
- 🖱️ Hover to pause functionality
- 🎨 Grayscale effect that removes on hover
- 📱 Responsive design
- 🔄 Automatic text fallback if images are missing

## 🧪 Testing Without Logos

The component has built-in fallback functionality. If logo images are not found, it will display the partner name as text instead.

To add your logos, simply drop the PNG/SVG files into the `public/partners/` folder with the exact names listed above.
